# sci-RNA-seq3

Check [this GitHub page](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/sci-RNA-seq_family.html) to see how __sci-RNA-seq3__ libraries are generated experimentally. This is a split-pool based combinatorial indexing strategy, where fixed cells are used as the reaction chamber. mRNA molecules are marked by oligo-dT primer with distinct barcodes in minibulk reactions in the plate format (the first plate). Then all cells are pooled and randomly distributed into a new plate (the second plate), where barcoded hairpin adaptor is ligated to add a second level barcode. After that, all cells are pooled again and 2000 - 4000 cells are randomly distributed into the well of a new plate (the third plate). Library preparation is performed in the third plate to add __i5__ and __i7__ indices. Single cells can be identified by the combination of the __RT barcode__, the __hairpin barcode__ and __i5 + i7__. It is an updated and improved version of the [__sci-RNA-seq__](./sci-RNA-seq.md) method.

## For Your Own Experiments

The read configuration is the same as a standard library:

| Order | Read             | Cycle   | Description                                                       |
|-------|------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Read 1           | 34      | This yields `R1_001.fastq.gz`, Hairpin barcode + UMI + RT barcode |
| 2     | Index 1 (__i7__) | 8 or 10 | This yields `I1_001.fastq.gz`, well barcode for the 3rd plate     |
| 3     | Index 2 (__i5__) | 8 or 10 | This yields `I2_001.fastq.gz`, well barcode for the 3rd plate     |
| 4     | Read 2           | >50     | This yields `R2_001.fastq.gz`, cDNA reads                         |

The content of __Read 1__ is like this:

| Length | Sequence (5' -> 3')                                                           |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 34     | 9 or 10 bp __Hairpin barcode__ + CAGAGC + 8 bp __UMI__ + 10 bp __RT barcode__ |

You can think of the 10 bp __RT barcode__ as the well barcode for the 1st plate, the __hairpin barcode__ as the well barcode for the 2nd plate and __i7 + i5__ are the well barcode for the 3rd plate. For a cell, it can go into a well in the 1st plate, then another well in the 2nd plate and finally a well in the 3rd plate. Different cells have very low chance of going through the same combination of wells in the three plates. Therefore, if reads have the same combination of well barcodes (__RT barcode + hairpin barcode + i7 + i5__), we can safely think they are from the same cell.

If you sequence the library via your core facility or a company, you need to provide the `i5` and `i7` index sequence you used during the library PCR. Like mentioned previously, they are basically the well barcode for the 3rd plate. Then you will get two `fastq` files (`R1` and `R2`) per well. The total file number will depend on how many wells in the 3rd plate you are processing.

If you sequence the library on your own, you need to get the `fastq` files by running `bcl2fastq` by yourself. In this case it is better to write a `SampleSheet.csv` with `i7` and `i5` indices for each well in the 3rd plate. This will yield the `fastq` files similar to those from your core facility or the company. Here is an example of the `SampleSheet.csv` from a NextSeq run with a full 96-well plate (3rd plate) using some standard Nextera indices:

```

Simply run `bcl2fastq` like this:

```console
bcl2fastq --no-lane-splitting \
          --ignore-missing-positions \
          --ignore-missing-controls \
          --ignore-missing-filter \
          --ignore-missing-bcls \
          -r 4 -w 4 -p 4
```

After this, you will have `R1_001.fastq.gz` and `R2_001.fastq.gz` for each well:

```bash
A1_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz # 34 bp: hairpin barcode + CAGAGC + UMI + RT barcode
A1_S1_R2_001.fastq.gz # 52 bp: cDNA
A2_S2_R1_001.fastq.gz # 34 bp: hairpin barcode + CAGAGC + UMI + RT barcode
A2_S2_R2_001.fastq.gz # 52 bp: cDNA
...
...
...
H11_S95_R1_001.fastq.gz # 34 bp: hairpin barcode + CAGAGC + UMI + RT barcode
H11_S95_R2_001.fastq.gz # 52 bp: cDNA
H12_S96_R1_001.fastq.gz # 34 bp: hairpin barcode + CAGAGC + UMI + RT barcode
H12_S96_R2_001.fastq.gz # 52 bp: cDNA
```

That's it. You are ready to go from here using `starsolo`. You can and should treat each well as separate experiments, and single cell can be identified by the combination of the __hairpin barcode__ and the __RT barcode__ in `R1`. Each well needs to be processed independently as if they are from different experiments. For example, the __hairpin + RT barcode__ `ACTTGATTGT + ACGTTCAACC` in the well __A1__ and the same barcode `ACTTGATTGT + ACGTTCAACC` in the well __A2__ represent different cells. Therefore, we need to generate count matrix for each well separately, and combine them in the downstream analysis.

The advantage of doing this is that we actually divide each experiment into small chunks, and use the exact the same procedures for each chunk independently. In addition, the whitelist will simply be the combination of the 9 or 10 bp __hairpin barcode__ and the 10 bp __RT barcode__ for all the analysis.

## Public Data

For the purpose of demonstration, we will use the __sci-RNA-seq3__ data from the following paper:

```{eval-rst}
.. note::

  Cao J, Spielmann M, Qiu X, Huang X, Ibrahim DM, Hill AJ, Zhang F, Mundlos S, Christiansen L, Steemers FJ, Trapnell C, Shendure J (2019) **The single-cell transcriptional landscape of mammalian organogenesis.** *Nature* 566:496â€“502. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-0969-x

```

where the authors developed an improved version of sci-RNA-seq, which they called __sci-RNA-seq3__. They used the technology to generate a comprehensive single cell atlas during mouse organogenesis, with > 2 million cells covering E9.5 - E13.5. The data is in GEO under the accession code [GSE119945](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE119945). You can get the `fastq` files directly from [__this ENA page__](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA490754?show=reads). As you can see, there are a total of 760 accessions. Each accession represents the data from a well in the 3rd plate. This means the authors already demultiplexed the data based on `i7 + i5` index for us. We could just download each accession and process independently. Single cells can be identified by the combination of the 9 or 10 bp __hairpin barcode__ and the 10 bp __RT barcode__.

I'm not going to do all 760 wells. Let's just use the data `SRR7827206` for the demonstration:

```console
# get fastq files
mkdir -p sci-rna-seq3/data
wget -P sci-rna-seq3/data \
    ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR782/006/SRR7827206/SRR7827206_1.fastq.gz \
    ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR782/006/SRR7827206/SRR7827206_2.fastq.gz
```

## Prepare Whitelist

The full oligo sequences can be found in the [Supplementary Table S11](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/data/sci-RNA-seq_family/41586_2019_969_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx) from the __sci-RNA-seq3__ paper. As you can see, there are a total of 384 different 10 bp __RT barcodes__, 384 different 9 or 10 bp __hairpin barcodes__, 96 different 10 bp __i7__ and 96 different 10 bp __i5__ barcodes. Theoretically, the full capacity of the combinatorial indices are __384 * 384 * 96 * 96 = 1,358,954,496__. Since the data are already demultiplexed by __i7 + i5__, we only need the hairpin barcode and RT barcode for the identification of single cells. I have collected the index table as follows, and the names of the oligos are directly taken from the paper to be consistent (showing only 5 records of each table):

__RT Barcodes (10 bp)__

| Name             | Sequence   | Reverse complement |
|------------------|------------|:------------------:|
| sc_ligation_RT_1 | TCCTACCAGT |     ACTGGTAGGA     |
| sc_ligation_RT_2 | GCGTTGGAGC |     GCTCCAACGC     |
| sc_ligation_RT_3 | GATCTTACGC |     GCGTAAGATC     |
| sc_ligation_RT_4 | CTGATGGTCA |     TGACCATCAG     |
| sc_ligation_RT_5 | CCGAGAATCC |     GGATTCTCGG     |

__Hairpin Barcodes (9 or 10 bp)__

| Name          | Sequence   | Reverse complement |
|---------------|------------|:------------------:|
| sc_ligation_1 | ACAATCAAGT |     ACTTGATTGT     |
| sc_ligation_2 | AAGCTGATTA |     TAATCAGCTT     |
| sc_ligation_3 | ACCATTCTTA |     TAAGAATGGT     |
| sc_ligation_4 | AATAGGTTGT |     ACAACCTATT     |
| sc_ligation_5 | ATCTAGGAAT |     ATTCCTAGAT     |

I have put those two tables into `csv` files and you can download them to have a look:

[sci-RNA-seq3_RT_bc.csv](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/data/sci-RNA-seq_family/sci-RNA-seq3_RT_bc.csv)  
[sci-RNA-seq3_hairpin_bc.csv](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/data/sci-RNA-seq_family/sci-RNA-seq3_hairpin_bc.csv) 

Let's download them:

```console
wget -P sci-rna-seq3/data \
    https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/data/sci-RNA-seq_family/sci-RNA-seq3_RT_bc.csv \
    https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/data/sci-RNA-seq_family/sci-RNA-seq3_hairpin_bc.csv
```

Now we need to generate the whitelist of the __RT barcode__ and the __hairpin barcode__. Those barcodes are sequenced in __Read 1__ using the bottom strand as the template. They are in the same direction of the Illumina TruSeq Read 1 sequence. Therefore, we should take their sequences as they are. In addition, if you check the [__sci-RNA-seq3 GitHub page__](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/sci-RNA-seq_family.html), you will see that the __hairpin barcode__ is in front of the __RT barcode__ in the final library. Therefore, we should pass the whitelist to `starsolo` in that order. See the next section for more details.

```bash
# hairpin barcode whitelist
tail -n +2 sci-rna-seq3/data/sci-RNA-seq3_hairpin_bc.csv | \
    cut -f 2 -d, > sci-rna-seq3/data/hairpin_whitelist.txt

# RT barcode whitelist
tail -n +2 sci-rna-seq3/data/sci-RNA-seq3_RT_bc.csv | \
    cut -f 2 -d, > sci-rna-seq3/data/RT_whitelist.txt
```

## From FastQ To Count Matrix

The variable length (9 or 10 bp) of __hairpin barcode__ makes the situation a bit more complicated. We need to run `starsolo` in the following way (see explanation later):

```console
# map and generate the count matrix

STAR --runThreadN 4 \
     --genomeDir mm10/star_index \
     --readFilesCommand zcat \
     --outFileNamePrefix sci-rna-seq3/star_outs/ \
     --readFilesIn sci-rna-seq3/data/SRR7827206_2.fastq.gz sci-rna-seq3/data/SRR7827206_1.fastq.gz \
     --soloType CB_UMI_Complex \
     --soloAdapterSequence CAGAGC \
     --soloCBposition 0_0_2_-1 3_9_3_18 \
     --soloUMIposition 3_1_3_8 \
     --soloCBwhitelist sci-rna-seq3/data/hairpin_whitelist.txt sci-rna-seq3/data/RT_whitelist.txt \
     --soloCBmatchWLtype 1MM \
     --soloCellFilter EmptyDrops_CR \
     --soloStrand Forward \
     --outSAMattributes CB UB \
     --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate
```

Once that is finished, you can do the exact the same thing with all the rest wells. In practice, you can do this via a loop or a pipeline. They can be run independently in parallel.

## Explanation

If you understand the __sci-RNA-seq3__ experimental procedures described in [this GitHub Page](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/sci-RNA-seq_family.html), the command above should be straightforward to understand.

`--runThreadN 4`
  
>> Use 4 cores for the preprocessing. Change accordingly if using more or less cores.

`--genomeDir mm10/star_index`

>> Pointing to the directory of the star index. The public data from the above paper was produced using mouse embryos.

`--readFilesCommand zcat`

>> Since the `fastq` files are in `.gz` format, we need the `zcat` command to extract them on the fly.

`--outFileNamePrefix sci-rna-seq3/star_outs/`

>> We want to keep everything organised. This parameter directs all output files into the `sci-rna-seq3/star_outs/` directory.

`--readFilesIn`

>> If you check the manual, we should put two files here. The first file is the reads that come from cDNA, and the second file should contain cell barcode and UMI. In __sci-RNA-seq3__, cDNA reads come from Read 2, and the cell barcode and UMI come from Read 1. Check [the sci-RNA-seq3 GitHub Page](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/sci-RNA-seq_family.html) if you are not sure.

`--soloType CB_UMI_Complex`

>> Since Read 1 not only has cell barcodes and UMI, the common linker sequences are also there. The cell barcodes are non-consecutive, separated by the linker sequences. In this case, we have to use the `CB_UMI_Complex` option. Of course, we could also use `UMI-tools` to extract the cell barcode and UMI, but that's slow. It is better to use this option.

`--soloAdapterSequence CAGAGC`

>> The variable length (9 or 10 bp) of the __hairpin barcode__ at the beginning of __Read 1__ makes the situation complicated, because the absolute positions of the __RT barcode__ and __UMI__ in each read will vary. However, by specifying an adapter sequence, we could use this sequence as an anchor, and tell the program where cell barcodes and UMI are located relatively to the anchor. `CAGAGC` is the constant linker sequence in the middle, separating the __hairpin barcode__ and __UMI__.

`--soloCBposition` and `--soloUMIposition`

>> These options specify the locations of cell barcode and UMI in the 2nd fastq files we passed to `--readFilesIn`. In this case, it is __Read 1__. Read the [STAR manual](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf) for more details. I have drawn a picture to help myself decide the exact parameters. There are some freedom here depending on what you are using as anchors. Due to the 9 or 10 bp __hairpin barcode__, the absolute positions of __RT barcodes__ and __UMI__ in the middle are variable. Therefore, using Read start as anchor will not work for them. We need to use the adaptor as the anchor, and specify the positions relative to the anchor. See the image:

![](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/data/sci-RNA-seq_family/Star_CB_UMI_Complex_sci-RNA-seq3.jpg)

```{eval-rst}
.. important::
  
  This option seems to work for me. Normally, we would choose an adapter sequence with decent length. In this case, we only have a short 6-bp constant linker as the adapter: ``CAGAGC``. If you look at the sequence in the **hairpin barcode** and the **RT barcode**, ``CAGAGC`` does not exist there. In the random 8-bp UMI, it might appear. When this happens, ``starsolo`` will only use the first appearance as the anchor, which is good here.
```

`--soloCBwhitelist`

>> Since the real cell barcodes consists of two non-consecutive parts: the __hairpin barcode__ and the __RT barcode__, the whitelist here is the combination of the two sub-lists. We should provide them separately and `star` will take care of the combinations.

`--soloCBmatchWLtype 1MM`

>> How stringent we want the cell barcode reads to match the whitelist. The default option (`1MM_Multi`) does not work here. We choose this one here for simplicity, but you might want to experimenting different parameters to see what the difference is.

`--soloCellFilter EmptyDrops_CR`

>> Experiments are never perfect. Even for barcodes that do not capture the molecules inside the cells, you may still get some reads due to various reasons, such as ambient RNA or DNA and leakage. In general, the number of reads from those cell barcodes should be much smaller, often orders of magnitude smaller, than those barcodes that come from real cells. In order to identify true cells from the background, you can apply different algorithms. Check the `star` manual for more information. We use `EmptyDrops_CR` which is the most frequently used parameter.

`--soloStrand Forward`

>> The choice of this parameter depends on where the cDNA reads come from, i.e. the reads from the first file passed to `--readFilesIn`. You need to check the experimental protocol. If the cDNA reads are from the same strand as the mRNA (the coding strand), this parameter will be `Forward` (this is the default). If they are from the opposite strand as the mRNA, which is often called the first strand, this parameter will be `Reverse`. In the case of __sci-RNA-seq3__, the cDNA reads are from the Read 2 file. During the experiment, the mRNA molecules are captured by barcoded oligo-dT primer containing UMI and the Illumina Read 1 sequence. Therefore, Read 1 consists of RT barcodes and UMI. They come from the first strand, complementary to the coding strand. Read 2 comes from the coding strand. Therefore, use `Forward` for __sci-RNA-seq3__ data. This `Forward` parameter is the default, because many protocols generate data like this, but I still specified it here to make it clear. Check [the sci-RNA-seq3 GitHub Page](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/sci-RNA-seq_family.html) if you are not sure.

`--outSAMattributes CB UB`

>> We want the cell barcode and UMI sequences in the `CB` and `UB` attributes of the output, respectively. The information will be very helpful for downstream analysis. 

`--outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate`

>> We want sorted `BAM` for easy handling by other programs.

If everything goes well, your directory should look the same as the following:
