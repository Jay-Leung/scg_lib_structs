<span style="font-size:1.1em;"><p>The combinatorial barcoding and targeted chromatin release (CoBATCH) uses the same strategy (combinatorial indexing) and oligo design as <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6237/910" target="_blank">sci-ATAC-seq</a>. This method is kind of a combination of sci-ATAC-seq and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09982-5">CUT&TAG</a>, where they used a protein A-Tn5 fusion protein to tether the pA-Tn5 to specific genomic loci bound by proteins of interest using antibodies.</p>

<p>For a brief introduction and backgound about the related methods, I have written a blog post. <a href="https://randomstate.net/2018-10-23-why-do-i-like-cut-and-run-more-than-chip-seq/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to have a look!</p>

<p>Since CoBATCH uses the same oligo design as sci-ATAC-seq, for the step-by-step library generation, it is the same as sci-ATAC-seq. Click the <a href="https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/sci-ATAC-seq.html" target="_blank">sci-ATAC-seq</a> page for details.</p></span>
