<span style="font-size:1.1em;"><p>The single-nucleus sci-ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) uses the same strategy (combinatorial indexing) and oligo design as <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6237/910" target="_blank">sci-ATAC-seq</a>. The snATAC-seq had some experimental modifications to make the method work in frozen tissue samples. They also uses slightly different PCR primers (8-bp index) and added spike-in oligos to increase the base balance in the middle of the index reads. The primers can be found from the <a href="../data/41593_2018_79_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx" target="_blank">Supplementary Table 5</a> from the paper. You can check the <a href="../data/41593_2018_79_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" target="_blank">Supplementary Figure 1</a> for detailed information about experimental optimisation the authors did.</p>

<p>For the step-by-step library generation, it is the same as sci-ATAC-seq. Click the <a href="https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/sci-ATAC-seq_family.html" target="_blank">sci-ATAC-seq</a> page for details.</p>
