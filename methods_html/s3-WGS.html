<h1><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00962-z" target="_blank">s3-WGS</a></h1>

<p><info>Due to semi-suppressive PCR (<a href="https://github.com/Teichlab/scg_lib_structs/issues/9#issuecomment-665438671" target="_blank">click here</a> to see a detailed explanation), only 50% of the tagmented material from the regular Tn5 are amplifiable. The <b>s3-WGS</b> approach introduced uracil bases in the Tn5 adapters and used uracil intolerant and tolerant DNA polymerases for the gap fill-in and PCR amplification, respectively. In this way, every Tn5 cutting event is amplifiable. The procedure is very similar to <a href="https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/s3-ATAC.html" target="_blank">s3-ATAC</a>, except that s3-WGS is perform on crosslinked and nucleosome-depleted nuclei.</info></p>

<p><info>The library structure of <b>s3-WGS</b> is the same as <b>s3-ATAC</b>. <a href="https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/s3-ATAC.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the detailed library generation steps.</info></p>
